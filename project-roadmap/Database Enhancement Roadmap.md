# Database Enhancement Roadmap

## üéØ Project Goals

Transform the COTC database from a basic awakening stone guide into a comprehensive character and equipment analysis system.

## üìã Phase 1: Data Normalization & Enhancement

### 1.1 Stone Priority Normalization
**Problem**: Multiple data sources have inconsistent awakening stone priority values
**Current Fields**: `ultPriority` (misleading name - covers all stones, not just ultimates)
**New Approach**: Dual-priority system with role-based recommendations

**Awakening Stone Rules**:
- **AS1**: Can only be `L10`, `A1`, or `Shard`
- **AS2+**: If previous stone was `Shard`, all following must be `Shard`
- **AS5**: Can be `A4`, `L10`, or `Shard`
- **Pattern**: Once you shard, everything after is shard
- **Valid Values**: `L10`, `A1`, `A2`, `A3`, `A4`, `Shard`, `""` (blank for uncertain)

**Awakening Stage Benefits**:
- **A1**: Provides stat boosts (HP, SP, ATK, DEF, etc.)
- **A2**: Unlocks additional skill slot  
- **A3**: Grants extra +1000 HP
- **A4**: Unlocks character-specific accessory
- **L10**: Unlocks ultimate skill at max level

**Dual-Priority System**:
Instead of complex combinations, use two separate priorities that combine to determine the awakening path:

1. **Priority Level**: High/Medium/Low/Skip
2. **Awakening Strategy**: Balanced/A4-First/Ultimate-First/Stats-First

This system provides clearer guidance while maintaining flexibility for different playstyles and resource availability.

### 1.2 Skills Database Integration
**Goal**: Extract and integrate all character skills from markdown files
**Approach**: Automated extraction with manual validation
**Benefits**: Enables skill-based search and analysis

### 1.3 Equipment Integration
**Goal**: Integrate accessory and weapon data
**Approach**: Cross-reference with game data sources
**Benefits**: Complete character build optimization

## üìã Phase 2: Advanced Analytics

### 2.1 Meta Analysis
- Character tier tracking over time
- Usage statistics and popularity metrics
- Performance analysis in different content types

### 2.2 Team Composition Tools
- Synergy analysis between characters
- Optimal team recommendations
- Role coverage analysis

### 2.3 Investment ROI Calculator
- Stone efficiency analysis
- Awakening priority optimization
- Resource allocation recommendations

## üìã Phase 3: Community Features

### 3.1 User-Generated Content
- Community tier lists
- User reviews and strategies
- Build sharing and ratings

### 3.2 Data Validation System
- Community-driven accuracy verification
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Quality scoring and trust metrics

## üóìÔ∏è Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks (Foundation)
**Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks (Analytics)
**Phase 3**: 4-6 weeks (Community)

## üìä Success Metrics

- **Data Quality**: 95%+ accuracy across all fields
- **Coverage**: 100% character completion
- **Community Engagement**: Active user contributions
- **Performance**: Sub-second search response times

*Status: Planning complete - Phase 1 ready for implementation*
