# Missing Data and Resources Needed

## Missing Character Portraits/Images

Based on previous analysis, we have 160 character portraits but 244 characters total, meaning approximately 84 characters are missing visual assets.

### Priority Missing Images
Characters without portraits need to be identified by comparing:
- `/images/characters/` directory contents
- Database character list (244 total)
- Focus on newer/recently released characters

## Missing Skill Icons

Current state:
- Have basic weapon and element icons
- Missing specific skill type icons
- Missing status effect icons for many skills

## Resources to Hunt Online

### Primary Sources
1. **COTC Wiki** (octopathtraveler.fandom.com)
   - Character skill descriptions
   - Ultimate/EX skill details
   - Character portraits and sprites
   
2. **Official COTC Database Sites**
   - meowdb.com - Community database
   - dotgg.gg - Game guides and data
   - octopathcotc.notion.site - Community resources

3. **Reddit Communities**
   - r/OctopathCotC - Main subreddit
   - Community spreadsheets with skill data
   - User-contributed guides

4. **Discord Communities**
   - COTC Global Discord
   - Data miners and contributors
   - High-resolution asset dumps

### Specific Data Needs

#### Asset Requirements
1. **Character Sprites** (244 needed total)
   - PNG format, transparent background
   - Minimum 256x256 resolution preferred
   - Both battle and portrait versions if available

2. **Skill Icons**
   - Ultimate skill icons (unique designs)
   - EX skill indicators
   - Blessing skill icons
   - Status effect icons (buffs/debuffs)

3. **Accessory Images**
   - A4 accessory icons
   - Exclusive accessory artwork
   - General accessory icons by type

## Data Quality Issues to Research

### Skills Database
- Verify ultimate skill SP costs (typically 48+ SP)
- Confirm EX skill availability for EX variant characters
- Check for missing blessing skills (blessing_of_lantern category)

### Character Data
- Release dates for Global version
- Proper romanization of Japanese names
- Collaboration character availability periods

### Tier Lists
- Current Global meta rankings
- A4 accessory priority updates
- Ultimate skill priority for team building

## Community Contacts

### Known Resources
- COTC Wiki administrators
- Reddit moderators who maintain spreadsheets
- Discord data-mining channels
- GitHub repositories with game data

### Potential Contributors

## Notes

- Collaboration characters (NieR, Live A Live) may have limited availability data
- Some character names have multiple spellings (Throné/Throne, H'aanit/Haanit)
- Japanese names may need verification for proper romanization
- Priority should be on Global version data, not JP version
